human can choose to block npc that cannot attack

---

equally blocking causes rubish on screen

initiativet puuttuu

arch:
	players vs clients
		player

		<= a bit of a mess right now, could be like...

	clients
		client
			- thread
			- socket

	players
		player


	... I dunno :-) Point being that now there are some methods that are basically dulpicated in player/s and client/s


---

run until damage

--

näytä lopuks vaan omat woundit

---

entteriä runsaasti =>
<susanna> bugaa menuun välillä?
<susanna> näitkö?

---

eli, jos vaikka ensin
	menu -> g -> f -> exception -> break telnet -> reconnect telnet -> n -> f -> fight goes through instanly, now enter pressing needed. figure it out.

---

git commit -a -m "chars can be loaded and saved, but 2nd menu should not auto-follow load or save so you can view and heal the char before you start, or you can create a new one. Also creating new chars and viewing them should be supported so you can fiddle at creating a good char"

Q from admin console doesn't take instant effect when in a fight

smart attack dead people

fumble on fumble could be upwards open-ended
